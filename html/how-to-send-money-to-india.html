    <h1>How to send Money to India.</h1>
    <p>
        TransferWise is one of the cheapest online money transfer services to send money anywhere in the world.
        Why do I say this? By experience. I have put this online money transfer service to the test and liked it.
        Cheap Transaction Costs TransferWise has adopted an ingenious system to help it bypass the high bank rates.

        The service allows its users to create local accounts from anywhere in the world. It
        then transfers money between users' local accounts, thus bypassing the high rates imposed
        by banks on international money transfers. In a sense, the money never crosses borders.
        These local accounts are multicurrency and can hold money in more than 40 different
        urrencies. This includes the U.S. Dollar, British Pound, Euro, and Indian Rupee,
        among many more. The money is converted to the desired currency in-house before transfer,
        further cutting costs.

        I'll put it in the figures for you. A Pound-to-Euro transfer would cost only 80p and
        commission of 0.35% of the entire transaction. This is about 8 times cheaper than
        the cheapest international bank transfer and considerably cheaper than most other
        online money transfer services.
